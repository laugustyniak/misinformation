# Misinformation Analysis in Social Media

Our group of researchers from Wrocław University of Science and Technology and Wrocław University works on misinformation analysis in Social Media. The area of misinformation analysis is not so widely known. Moreover, there also do not exist any Machine Learning-based solutions for working with Polish text in this area. We want to fill this gap. We create and openly publish datasets and well as trained models that can be used to analyzed Polish Social Media content on a vast scale.
